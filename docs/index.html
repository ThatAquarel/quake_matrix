        <h3>
          Variational Autoencoders for Data Augmentation in Lunar Seismic
          Frequency Domain Analysis Using Convolutional Neural Networks
        </h3>
        <h4>A Little Bit of Context</h4>
        <p>
          Seismic detection in our solar system can seem like something absurd
          or even useless at first glance. Why would one ever want to study the
          timing of moonquakes or its frequencies ? When our team started
          studying the question, we discovered many different interesting things
          about this subject which we are super excited to teach you about. Be
          ready to further your understanding of concepts like moonquakes
          frequencies, the pattern they follow, their structures and more !
        </p>

        <h4>A Problem of Data...</h4>

        <p>
          Training a super efficient model seems great in theory until you
          realize that you can only do so if you have a huge amount of data to
          train it on. This can vary from case to case but most models take tens
          in not hundreds of thousands of lines of data before becoming super
          accurate. We had 74. 74 lines are, of course, not even remotely close
          enough to train a well designed model, especially since seismic data
          is pretty detailed. This problem led us to one of the most useful
          tools we had ever encountered : variational encoders.
        </p>

        <h4>Our Project</h4>

        <p>
          No doubt, learning from patterns in order to understand how moonquakes
          work is awesome ! However, how do we get to analyze all of this data
          and deduce things from it ? With a 2D deep learning convolutional
          model. 2D models allow us to analyze graphical patterns in large
          scaled training data and to store all of them in a feature map. The
          model will then try to identify those same patterns in regular data
          that doesn't have any label or indications. This all seemed in our
          programmers mind until we faced a big problem, the data !
        </p>

        <h4>Variational Autoencoders and Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>
        <p>
          Variational encoders are a super useful tool that allows us to
          generate more accurate and representative data based on the one that
          we already have. It starts by deconstructing our graphs into less
          complicated versions of themselves only to then compare them to the
          actual data in order to learn its detailed patterns and structures.
          Once these complicated patterns are encoded in its memory, it builds
          new data from it and gets a desired number of hyper-realistic graphs.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also feel like it's important to mention that before generating new
          data, we converted the time series graphs into spectrograms in which
          the patterns are way easier to analyze for the variational encoder.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this leads up to feeding the data into our designed 2D
          convolutional deep learning model which takes into acquisition all of
          the graphs patterns and then tries to identify those same structures
          and movements into the “non-identified data”, the 30 year of seismic
          frequencies on the mars and the moon in order to identify all of the
          unlisted earthquakes that have happened during this time range.
        </p>
        <h4>Real World Applications</h4>
        <p>
          Our trained 2D convolutional model, being very straightforward and not
          space heavy , could be sent to all sorts of planets in order to
          directly record and identify quakes on their surface. This would give
          us a tremendous amount of data which could then helps us better
          understand the tectonic plates formations of other planets and how
          they affect seismic frequencies on their surface.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

        <p>
          Seismic quakes all have extremely similar patterns which all can be,
          with enough training data, properly identified and registered. There
          are a lot of similarities between the structures of different quakes
          whether it is on earth, the moon or even mars ! In conclusion, these
          arrangements are definitely not exclusive to the moon, with a little
          bit of modification, a model that could be applicable would be
          possible !
