What we learned : 

Seismic quakes all have extremely similar patterns which all can be, with enough training data, properly identified and registered. 

There are a lot of similarities between the structures of different quakes whether it is on earth, the moon or even mars !

In conclusion, these arrangements are definitely not exclusive to the moon, with a little bit of modification, a model that could be applicable would be possible !
