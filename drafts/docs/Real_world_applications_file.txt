Real world applications : 

Our trained 2D convolutional model, being very straightforward and not space heavy , could be sent to all sorts of planets in order to directly record and identify quakes on their surface. This would give us a tremendous amount of data which could then helps us better understand the tectonic plates formations of other planets and how they affect seismic frequencies on their surface.
