A little bit of context : 

Seismic detection in our solar system can seem like something absurd or even useless at first glance. Why would one ever want to study the timing of moonquakes or its frequencies ? When our team started studying the question, we discovered many different interesting things about this subject which we are super excited to teach you about. Be ready to further your understanding of concepts like moonquakes frequencies, the pattern they follow, their structures and more !
